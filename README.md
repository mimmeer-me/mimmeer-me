## Hello Developer! 😄
###### (Tried to put my own custom emoji there but got destroyed by GitHub's silly image positioning. 

I am Mimmeer, and this is my newest GitHub account.
##### My previous one was a bit of a mess, so fresh start, fresh mindset!


## What can I do?

I can code in C#, JS, HTML, Python, MicroPython, CSS, XAML, ASM, C and dare I say... C++. (ordered from best at to worst at)
Yes, I know, long list.

Here is a Hello World for each one.
